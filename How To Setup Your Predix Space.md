# How To Setup Your Predix Space

With your Predix account, you have access to your team space in one of these orgs:
- predixbuilders2
- predixbuilder3
- predixbuilder4  

Your team space name is: team# (# is your team number).

In order to help you to quickly start the challenge, we've created a script to deploy your services for you.

## Getting Started


## Apps

### MMSanFrancisco-ui

We deployed a 'MMSanFrancisco-ui' app to show you how to request and plot time series data from the heatpump timeseries instance. Please note that another timeseries instance is available with ESB load & weather data. You just need to bind your app with another timeseries instance to start working with it.

You can give it a try (replace # with your team number):
- App URL:
https://mmeurope-ui-team#.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io
- UserID: TEAM_#
- User Secret: TEAM_#

**The source code of this app can be found in the "Seed app" folder in this GitHub repo.**

## SERVICES

In your space you are going to see multiple services:
* **mmsanfrancisco-uaa**
* **mmsanfrancisco-time-series**
* **MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_heatPump** [(CUPS)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)
* **MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_loadData** [(CUPS)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)
* **MMSanFrancisco_uaa_admin** [(CUPS)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)

### mmsanfrancisco-uaa

The User Account and Authentication Service (UAA) is a OAuth2 server that can be used for centralized identity management. You can have a look at UAA [here](https://docs.predix.io/en-US/content/service/security/user_account_and_authentication/).

The **admin secret** is : secret

We already created 1 UAA client and 1 user:
* **Client ID** : app_client_id
* **Client Secret** : secret
* **User ID**:  app_user_1#
* **User Secret** : app_user_1#

### MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_heatPump

We have ingested all the EHPA/Fraunhofer heat pump data into a Time Series instance located in our admin space. ([documentation](https://docs.predix.io/en-US/content/service/data_management/time_series/) about Time Series)

You have access to this Time Series instance in read-only mode.You’ll find how to access this data and an example [here](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge/Heatpump%20Timeseries%20Dataset).

**NB:**
- The time series instance is **not in your space** but in an admin space. The service you can see in your space is a [**cups**](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html).
- MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_heatPump & MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_loadData are not the same TimeSeries instance.

### MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_loadData

We store all data from load data and weather data into a Time Series instance ([documentation](https://docs.predix.io/en-US/content/service/data_management/time_series/) about Time Series)

You have access our Time Series instance only in read only.You’ll find how to access to this data and an example [here](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-europe/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge/Grid%20Timeseries%20Dataset)

**NB:**
- The time series instance is **not in your space** but in an admin space. The service you can see in your space is a [**cups**](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)  
- MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_heatPump & MMSanFrancisco_timeseries_loadData are not the same TimeSeries instance.

#### MMSanFrancisco_uaa_admin
To access our two Admin TimeSeries instances, you need credentials and token. So, we have created a [**cups**](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html) in order to easily bind this UAA for TimeSeries with your app.

**NB:** With this cups you can only get informations to request data on our two TimeSeries instances. For app authentication, analytics framework, intelligent-mapping,..., you have to use your own UAA instance called **MMEurope-uaa**.
